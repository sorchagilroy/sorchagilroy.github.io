Hi! My name is Sorcha Gilroy and I'm a data scientist working at [Peak](peak.ai) in Manchester, UK. I've been at Peak since June 2019 and before that did a PhD in [natural language processing at the University of Edinburgh](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/). I've always had a strong interest in science communication and so I decided to start writing this blog. It's intended to be introductory and for a totally non technical audience. If there's something in this area you've always wanted to know about, feel free to send suggestions via twitter or email (both linked below).
